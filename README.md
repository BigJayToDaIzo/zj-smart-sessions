  The goal of this project is to speed up my workflow with zellij sessions. It implements fuzzy finding,
  that matches on a combination of session and tab name to directly find the corresponding tab in a
  session.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is an early development version and does not have all features implemented. With future APIs, there will be the last used session at the top. Also one goal is to navigate to the last focused tab & pane, when attaching to a session.
